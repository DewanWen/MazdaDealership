Introduction
  The MazdaDealership application is a showcase of how I could add value to a business.
  I will be treating this project as such:
    - Mazda is a true identity communicating with me. 
    - Deadlines are given on all tasks.
    - Tickets are created for all tasks.
    
Case
  Mazda has bought a building in Kempton Park, they have requested an inventory system to be created, as they are opening the business with select stock 
  to test against the value grain of Kempton Park residents and surrounding areas.
  
  If this business venture becomes a success they will require additional software support. 
  
Scope of Work
  - A database.
  - An inventory handling system.
